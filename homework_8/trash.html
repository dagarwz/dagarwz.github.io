      <h4>Pikes Peak in Pike National Forest</h4>
      <p class="text">
        At 14,115 feet in elevation, Pikes Peak, in Pike National Forest, is one
        of the Southwest's famous "fourteeners," a reference to mountains that
        stand over 14,000 feet. The snow-capped peak is easily recognizable from
        the nearby town of Colorado Springs. This is one of the most visited
        mountains in the world, second only to Mt. Fuji. Unlike many mountain
        peaks that are inaccessible to the average person, you can drive to the
        summit of Pikes Peak on the Pikes Peak Highway, off highway 24, west of
        Colorado Springs. Travel time is about 1.5 hours. Alternatively, you can
        take the Pikes Peak Cog Railway for a scenic 8.9-mile trip, with a
        round-trip time of just over three hours. In addition to simply
        appreciating the views from the top, the area offers a range of
        recreational opportunities. In the vicinity are numerous hiking trails,
        as well as mountain biking areas and opportunities for fishing in
        reservoirs.

      <h4>Vail and Nearby Mountain Towns</h4>
      <p class="text">
        The ski resort town of Vail is one of the best places to visit in
        Colorado in winter but it's also a pleasant place to enjoy at any time
        of year. When it comes to skiing, this is one of the top ski resorts in
        Colorado, with seemingly endless runs for all levels of skiers. The town
        at the base of the ski hill is postcard cute, with chalet-style
        restaurants, shops, and hotels that make you feel like you are in the
        heart of the Alps. This is a high-end resort with luxury hotels, fine
        dining, and designer stores. Vail doesn't always fit with everyone's
        budget, particularly if you want to spend a night during the high
        season. In the vicinity are a number of small towns and villages that
        are less well known but more affordable and also worth a visit. Although
        not a ski resort, Frisco is a charming mountain town and one of the best
        places to visit in the area. This is a nice base if you are exploring
        the I-70 Corridor around Vail and Beaver Creek. The town has all kinds
        of quirky cafés, shops, and restaurants, and a true mountain vibe. Just
        up the way from here is the small town and ski resort of Breckenridge,
        at an altitude of 9,600 feet. This town has a very casual and fun
        downtown and is perfect if you plan on skiing at Breckenridge or looking
        for a little nightlife. West of Vail are the towns of Avon and, a little
        beyond Avon, Beaver Creek. Avon can be a good place to find
        accommodation, particularly if you are looking for more affordable
        options than those at the base of the ski hills. Beaver Creek is a ski
        resort with another adorable village at the base. It has a full range of
        restaurants, from casual to fine dining, a skating rink in the main
        square in winter, and hotels.
