                  <h4>Pikes Peak in Pike National Forest</h4>
                  <p>
                    At 14,115 feet in elevation, Pikes Peak, in Pike National
                    Forest, is one of the Southwest's famous "fourteeners," a
                    reference to mountains that stand over 14,000 feet. The
                    snow-capped peak is easily recognizable from the nearby town
                    of Colorado Springs. This is one of the most visited
                    mountains in the world, second only to Mt. Fuji. Unlike many
                    mountain peaks that are inaccessible to the average person,
                    you can drive to the summit of Pikes Peak on the Pikes Peak
                    Highway, off highway 24, west of Colorado Springs. Travel
                    time is about 1.5 hours. Alternatively, you can take the
                    Pikes Peak Cog Railway for a scenic 8.9-mile trip, with a
                    round-trip time of just over three hours. In addition to
                    simply appreciating the views from the top, the area offers
                    a range of recreational opportunities. In the vicinity are
                    numerous hiking trails, as well as mountain biking areas and
                    opportunities for fishing in reservoirs.

                  <h4>Vail and Nearby Mountain Towns</h4>
                  <p>
                    The ski resort town of Vail is one of the best places to
                    visit in Colorado in winter but it's also a pleasant place
                    to enjoy at any time of year. When it comes to skiing, this
                    is one of the top ski resorts in Colorado, with seemingly
                    endless runs for all levels of skiers. The town at the base
                    of the ski hill is postcard cute, with chalet-style
                    restaurants, shops, and hotels that make you feel like you
                    are in the heart of the Alps. This is a high-end resort with
                    luxury hotels, fine dining, and designer stores. Vail
                    doesn't always fit with everyone's budget, particularly if
                    you want to spend a night during the high season. In the
                    vicinity are a number of small towns and villages that are
                    less well known but more affordable and also worth a visit.
                    Although not a ski resort, Frisco is a charming mountain
                    town and one of the best places to visit in the area. This
                    is a nice base if you are exploring the I-70 Corridor around
                    Vail and Beaver Creek. The town has all kinds of quirky
                    caf√©s, shops, and restaurants, and a true mountain vibe.
                    Just up the way from here is the small town and ski resort
                    of Breckenridge, at an altitude of 9,600 feet. This town has
                    a very casual and fun downtown and is perfect if you plan on
                    skiing at Breckenridge or looking for a little nightlife.
                    West of Vail are the towns of Avon and, a little beyond
                    Avon, Beaver Creek. Avon can be a good place to find
                    accommodation, particularly if you are looking for more
                    affordable options than those at the base of the ski hills.
                    Beaver Creek is a ski resort with another adorable village
                    at the base. It has a full range of restaurants, from casual
                    to fine dining, a skating rink in the main square in winter,
                    and hotels.
