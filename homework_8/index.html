                    <p>
                      At 14,115 feet in elevation, Pikes Peak, in Pike National
                      Forest, is one of the Southwest's famous "fourteeners," a
                      reference to mountains that stand over 14,000 feet. The
                      snow-capped peak is easily recognizable from the nearby
                      town of Colorado Springs. This is one of the most visited
                      mountains in the world, second only to Mt. Fuji. Unlike
                      many mountain peaks that are inaccessible to the average
                      person, you can drive to the summit of Pikes Peak on the
                      Pikes Peak Highway, off highway 24, west of Colorado
                      Springs. Travel time is about 1.5 hours. Alternatively,
                      you can take the Pikes Peak Cog Railway for a scenic
                      8.9-mile trip, with a round-trip time of just over three
                      hours. In addition to simply appreciating the views from
                      the top, the area offers a range of recreational
                      opportunities. In the vicinity are numerous hiking trails,
                      as well as mountain biking areas and opportunities for
                      fishing in reservoirs.
