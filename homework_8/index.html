            <h4>Pikes Peak in Pike National Forest</h4>
            <p class="text">
              At 14,115 feet in elevation, Pikes Peak, in Pike National Forest,
              is one of the Southwest's famous "fourteeners," a reference to
              mountains that stand over 14,000 feet. The snow-capped peak is
              easily recognizable from the nearby town of Colorado Springs. This
              is one of the most visited mountains in the world, second only to
              Mt. Fuji. Unlike many mountain peaks that are inaccessible to the
              average person, you can drive to the summit of Pikes Peak on the
              Pikes Peak Highway, off highway 24, west of Colorado Springs.
              Travel time is about 1.5 hours. Alternatively, you can take the
              Pikes Peak Cog Railway for a scenic 8.9-mile trip, with a
              round-trip time of just over three hours. In addition to simply
              appreciating the views from the top, the area offers a range of
              recreational opportunities. In the vicinity are numerous hiking
              trails, as well as mountain biking areas and opportunities for
              fishing in reservoirs.

            <h4>Vail and Nearby Mountain Towns</h4>
            <p class="text">
              The ski resort town of Vail is one of the best places to visit in
              Colorado in winter but it's also a pleasant place to enjoy at any
              time of year. When it comes to skiing, this is one of the top ski
              resorts in Colorado, with seemingly endless runs for all levels of
              skiers. The town at the base of the ski hill is postcard cute,
              with chalet-style restaurants, shops, and hotels that make you
              feel like you are in the heart of the Alps. This is a high-end
              resort with luxury hotels, fine dining, and designer stores. Vail
              doesn't always fit with everyone's budget, particularly if you
              want to spend a night during the high season. In the vicinity are
              a number of small towns and villages that are less well known but
              more affordable and also worth a visit. Although not a ski resort,
              Frisco is a charming mountain town and one of the best places to
              visit in the area. This is a nice base if you are exploring the
              I-70 Corridor around Vail and Beaver Creek. The town has all kinds
              of quirky caf√©s, shops, and restaurants, and a true mountain vibe.
              Just up the way from here is the small town and ski resort of
              Breckenridge, at an altitude of 9,600 feet. This town has a very
              casual and fun downtown and is perfect if you plan on skiing at
              Breckenridge or looking for a little nightlife. West of Vail are
              the towns of Avon and, a little beyond Avon, Beaver Creek. Avon
              can be a good place to find accommodation, particularly if you are
              looking for more affordable options than those at the base of the
              ski hills. Beaver Creek is a ski resort with another adorable
              village at the base. It has a full range of restaurants, from
              casual to fine dining, a skating rink in the main square in
              winter, and hotels.
