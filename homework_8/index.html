                <h4>Pikes Peak in Pike National Forest</h4>
                <p>
                  At 14,115 feet in elevation, Pikes Peak, in Pike National
                  Forest, is one of the Southwest's famous "fourteeners," a
                  reference to mountains that stand over 14,000 feet. The
                  snow-capped peak is easily recognizable from the nearby town
                  of Colorado Springs. This is one of the most visited mountains
                  in the world, second only to Mt. Fuji. Unlike many mountain
                  peaks that are inaccessible to the average person, you can
                  drive to the summit of Pikes Peak on the Pikes Peak Highway,
                  off highway 24, west of Colorado Springs. Travel time is about
                  1.5 hours. Alternatively, you can take the Pikes Peak Cog
                  Railway for a scenic 8.9-mile trip, with a round-trip time of
                  just over three hours. In addition to simply appreciating the
                  views from the top, the area offers a range of recreational
                  opportunities. In the vicinity are numerous hiking trails, as
                  well as mountain biking areas and opportunities for fishing in
                  reservoirs.
